# AWS terraform template

## BEFORE USING IT

Create the file "terraform.tfvars" containing the values for the variabled declared in the "variables.tf" file. That file is added to the .gitignore since contains sensitive information such as AWS keys and it is not recommended to upload it to git. If you know what you are doing and where you are uploading it, then go ahead and feel free to comment the line in the gitignore file.
